In Japan, they are known as **Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団)**, which translates similarly. In July 2017, BTS announced that in addition to being known as _Bangtan Sonyeondan_ or _Bulletproof Boy Scouts_, the acronym would also stand for **"Beyond The Scene"** as part of their new brand identity.

## BTS Artistry

![Army](https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bts-variety-cover-shoot-full-band-1-16x9-1.jpg)

BTS co-writes, produces, and composes much of their output, to which some media outlets have attributed their success. Since their inception, BTS has developed and maintained a style of "fusion music" with an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers and their main producer Pdogg. Rather than wanting to stick to a specific genre, BTS has introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. BTS' sound began with old-school hip hop influences heard on _2 Cool 4 Skool_ and _O!RUL8,2?_, but evolved to include R&B and rock with _Skool Luv Affair_ and _Dark and Wild_, orchestral strings and electronic dance music with their _The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series_, moombahton, neo soul, and gospel in _Wings_ and _You Never Walk Alone_, and future bass, Latin pop, and jazz hip hop in their _Love Yourself album series_.

BTS' lyrics are known for their social commentary, often incorporating criticism of South Korean society. Songs such as _"No More Dream"_ and _"N.O"_ from their _"school trilogy"_ were deeply motivated by their experiences with South Korea's emphasis on education and called for change to the education system and societal expectations. Their experiences with youth culture in South Korea inspired songs like _"Dope"_ and _"Silver Spoon"_ (Korean: 뱁새; RR: **Baepsae**) from their "youth series," referencing generational disparity and the millennial's giving up of romantic relationships, marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations. The song _"Am I Wrong"_ from Wings (2016) questioned societal apathy towards the state of current events—the lyric "We're all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we're angry" referenced the South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook who was a proponent of the caste system and described the average person as "dogs and pigs," and BTS performed the song on television during the 2016 South Korean political scandal that led to the impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye. RM and Suga's personal struggles with mental health inspired songs like _"Tomorrow"_, _"Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life"_, _"So Far Away"_, _"The Last"_, and _"Forever Rain."_ _"Not Today"_ from You Never Walk Alone (2017) is an anti-establishment anthem, with messages advocating for minority groups, while _"Spring Day"_ was created to memorialize the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy.

Grace Jeong, editor-in-chief of Soompi, praised the group by stating that, _“BTS has something to say, and has a great marketing strategy that doesn’t alienate non-Korean-speaking fans.”_ While they have received praise for their lyrics, in 2016 the group faced criticisms of misogyny regarding the lyrics of _"War of Hormone"_, _"Converse High"_, and RM's solo song _"Joke"_, as well as a Twitter comment made by Suga. The group's label later issued an apology.

BTS' has cited Nas, Eminem, Kanye West, Drake, Post Malone, and Charlie Puth as musical inspirations. BTS has also cited Queen as an influence, saying they "grew up watching videos of Live Aid.” During their concert at Wembley Stadium in London, Jin paid tribute to Queen by leading the crowd in a version of Freddie Mercury’s "ay-oh" chant from the band’s Live Aid concert.

In addition to musical inspirations, BTS also takes many inspirations from literary, psychological, artistic, and philosophical mediums. Their album Wings is inspired by Hermann Hesse's coming of age novel, Demian. Their song _"Blood Sweat & Tears"_ references Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zurathustra, Herbert James Draper's The Lament for Icarus, Pieter Bruegel's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, and Pieter Bruegel's The Fall of the Rebel Angels by quoting Nietzsche and featuring the three aforementioned paintings in the music video. Their _"Spring Day"_ music video contains lyrical and visual references to Ursula Le Guin's short story The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas. J-Hope's solo mixtape, **Hope World**, and its lead single _Daydream_ were inspired by Jules Verne's novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, as well as containing a reference to Douglas Adams's science fiction series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Love Yourself series was primarily influenced by Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving, while their song _"Magic Shop"_ of **Love Yourself: Tear** was inspired by James R. Doty's memoir Into the Magic Shop. Their 2019 album **Map of the Soul: Persona** gains its name from Murray Stein's Jung's Map of the Soul: An Introduction.

South Korean president Moon Jae-in, in a congratulatory letter he wrote to BTS, recognized their sincerity and inclusion of diversity as the group's key to success. Moon stated that "Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions." The Wire mentioned in their article that "BTS are big because they are “different” because they put creative input to the band’s sound".

Since the beginning of their career they have been delivering social messages through their lyrics. Their lyrics would be open about the cultural pressure placed on Korean teens to excel and do well and to repress their anxieties._“We came together with a common dream to write, dance and produce music that reflects our musical backgrounds as well as our life values of acceptance, vulnerability and being successful,”_ said BTS’s leader, RM, in a 2017 interview with Time. Their debut single, _“No More Dream,”_ was an ode to teen apathy. BTS’s success was due to mixing their openness on social media with blunt and honest lyrics — and owning their status as an underdog group battling to succeed against other bands who came from established studios with larger budgets. _“Dope”_ openly celebrated the endless grind of their lives: “Over half of the day, we drown in work / Even if our youth rots in the studio / Thanks to that, we’re closer to success.”
