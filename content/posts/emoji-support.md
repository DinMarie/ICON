Known for their passionate support and incredible organization, ARMYs have played a pivotal role in BTS’s rise to global stardom.

ARMYs’ impact extends beyond music. The fandom has participated in numerous charitable initiatives inspired by BTS, such as raising funds for UNICEF through the "Love Myself" campaign and supporting various social causes worldwide.
