<p><img alt="Bighit Music" loading="lazy" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTxb_sKaMAA_x8t?format=jpg&name=4096x4096"></p>
<p>BTS (Hangul: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The name became a backronym for Beyond the Scene in July 2017. Their official color is Purple and their official light-stick color is grey.The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Initially rooted in hip hop, BTS&rsquo; musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several world tours.</p>
<p>The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, <em>2 Cool 4 Skool</em> (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries <em>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2</em> (2015), <em>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever</em> (2016), and <em>Wings</em> (2016) helped establish BTS&rsquo; reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS&rsquo; first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the <strong>Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)</strong> with their single <em>&ldquo;Mic Drop.&rdquo;</em> The band is the first and only Korean act as of 2019 to top the U.S. Billboard 200 with their studio album <em>Love Yourself: Tear</em> (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums <em>Love Yourself: Answer</em> (2018) and <em>Map of the Soul: Persona</em> (2019), making BTS the first group since The Beatles to earn three number one albums in less than a year. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea&rsquo;s Gaon Album Chart&rsquo;s all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Gold in the United States.</p>
<p>In 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide. In 2019, Map of the Soul: Persona became the best-selling album in Korean history, and BTS became the best-selling artist in South Korea of all time, having sold over fourteen million albums. The group won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music Awards. Time magazine has named the band one of the 25 most influential people on the internet, featured them on their international cover as &ldquo;Next Generation Leaders,&rdquo; and named them one of Time 100&rsquo;s most influential people of 2019. Forbes Korea Power Celebrity has named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018. BTS are worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea&rsquo;s economy each year, attracting one in every 13 foreign tourists that visit the country, and are cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018, a figure not seen since 2006 after digital purchases gained momentum.</p>

<p>The group&rsquo;s name, BTS, is an acronym for the Korean expression <strong>Bangtan Sonyeondan (Hangul: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團)</strong>, literally meaning <em>&ldquo;Bulletproof Boy Scouts&rdquo;</em>. The name was conceptualized with the thought that BTS would block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets and protect the values and ideals of today’s adolescents. In Japan, they are known as <strong>Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団)</strong>, which translates similarly. In July 2017, BTS announced that in addition to being known as <em>Bangtan Sonyeondan</em> or <em>Bulletproof Boy Scouts</em>, the acronym would also stand for <strong>&ldquo;Beyond The Scene&rdquo;</strong> as part of their new brand identity. This extended their name to mean &ldquo;growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward.</p>

The fandom name <strong>ARMY</strong>, which stands for <strong>Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth</strong>, reflects the deep connection between BTS and their fans. It symbolizes a strong, unified force that stands beside BTS, much like an army does. The name aligns with BTS&rsquo;s Korean name, <strong>Bangtan Sonyeondan (방탄소년단)</strong>, meaning &ldquo;<strong>Bulletproof Boy Scouts</strong>,&rdquo; emphasizing how BTS protects the hopes and dreams of youth. Similarly, ARMY serves as a supportive shield for BTS, amplifying their message and achievements. The name also highlights themes of protection, unity, and empowerment, resonating with BTS’s mission to inspire and uplift young people around the world.</p>

<p>BTS co-writes, produces, and composes much of their output, to which some media outlets have attributed their success. Since their inception, BTS has developed and maintained a style of &ldquo;fusion music&rdquo; with an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga&rsquo;s background as underground rappers and their main producer Pdogg. Rather than wanting to stick to a specific genre, BTS has introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. BTS&rsquo; sound began with old-school hip hop influences heard on <em>2 Cool 4 Skool</em> and <em>O!RUL8,2?</em>, but evolved to include R&amp;B and rock with <em>Skool Luv Affair</em> and <em>Dark and Wild</em>, orchestral strings and electronic dance music with their <em>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series</em>, moombahton, neo soul, and gospel in <em>Wings</em> and <em>You Never Walk Alone</em>, and future bass, Latin pop, and jazz hip hop in their <em>Love Yourself album series</em>.</p>
<p>BTS&rsquo; lyrics are known for their social commentary, often incorporating criticism of South Korean society. Songs such as <em>&ldquo;No More Dream&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;N.O&rdquo;</em> from their <em>&ldquo;school trilogy&rdquo;</em> were deeply motivated by their experiences with South Korea&rsquo;s emphasis on education and called for change to the education system and societal expectations. Their experiences with youth culture in South Korea inspired songs like <em>&ldquo;Dope&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;Silver Spoon&rdquo;</em> (Korean: 뱁새; RR: <strong>Baepsae</strong>) from their &ldquo;youth series,&rdquo; referencing generational disparity and the millennial&rsquo;s giving up of romantic relationships, marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations. The song <em>&ldquo;Am I Wrong&rdquo;</em> from Wings (2016) questioned societal apathy towards the state of current events—the lyric &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we&rsquo;re angry&rdquo; referenced the South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook who was a proponent of the caste system and described the average person as &ldquo;dogs and pigs,&rdquo; and BTS performed the song on television during the 2016 South Korean political scandal that led to the impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye. RM and Suga&rsquo;s personal struggles with mental health inspired songs like <em>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;So Far Away&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;The Last&rdquo;</em>, and <em>&ldquo;Forever Rain.&rdquo;</em> <em>&ldquo;Not Today&rdquo;</em> from You Never Walk Alone (2017) is an anti-establishment anthem, with messages advocating for minority groups, while <em>&ldquo;Spring Day&rdquo;</em> was created to memorialize the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy.</p>
<p>Grace Jeong, editor-in-chief of Soompi, praised the group by stating that, <em>“BTS has something to say, and has a great marketing strategy that doesn’t alienate non-Korean-speaking fans.”</em> While they have received praise for their lyrics, in 2016 the group faced criticisms of misogyny regarding the lyrics of <em>&ldquo;War of Hormone&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Converse High&rdquo;</em>, and RM&rsquo;s solo song <em>&ldquo;Joke&rdquo;</em>, as well as a Twitter comment made by Suga. The group&rsquo;s label later issued an apology.</p>
<p>BTS&rsquo; has cited Nas, Eminem, Kanye West, Drake, Post Malone, and Charlie Puth as musical inspirations. BTS has also cited Queen as an influence, saying they &ldquo;grew up watching videos of Live Aid.” During their concert at Wembley Stadium in London, Jin paid tribute to Queen by leading the crowd in a version of Freddie Mercury’s &ldquo;ay-oh&rdquo; chant from the band’s Live Aid concert.</p>
<p>In addition to musical inspirations, BTS also takes many inspirations from literary, psychological, artistic, and philosophical mediums. Their album Wings is inspired by Hermann Hesse&rsquo;s coming of age novel, Demian. Their song <em>&ldquo;Blood Sweat &amp; Tears&rdquo;</em> references Friedrich Nietzsche&rsquo;s Thus Spoke Zurathustra, Herbert James Draper&rsquo;s The Lament for Icarus, Pieter Bruegel&rsquo;s Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, and Pieter Bruegel&rsquo;s The Fall of the Rebel Angels by quoting Nietzsche and featuring the three aforementioned paintings in the music video. Their <em>&ldquo;Spring Day&rdquo;</em> music video contains lyrical and visual references to Ursula Le Guin&rsquo;s short story The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas. J-Hope&rsquo;s solo mixtape, <strong>Hope World</strong>, and its lead single <em>Daydream</em> were inspired by Jules Verne&rsquo;s novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, as well as containing a reference to Douglas Adams&rsquo;s science fiction series The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy. The Love Yourself series was primarily influenced by Erich Fromm&rsquo;s The Art of Loving, while their song <em>&ldquo;Magic Shop&rdquo;</em> of <strong>Love Yourself: Tear</strong> was inspired by James R. Doty&rsquo;s memoir Into the Magic Shop. Their 2019 album <strong>Map of the Soul: Persona</strong> gains its name from Murray Stein&rsquo;s Jung&rsquo;s Map of the Soul: An Introduction.</p>
<p>South Korean president Moon Jae-in, in a congratulatory letter he wrote to BTS, recognized their sincerity and inclusion of diversity as the group&rsquo;s key to success. Moon stated that &ldquo;Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions.&rdquo; The Wire mentioned in their article that &ldquo;BTS are big because they are “different” because they put creative input to the band’s sound&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of their career they have been delivering social messages through their lyrics. Their lyrics would be open about the cultural pressure placed on Korean teens to excel and do well and to repress their anxieties.<em>“We came together with a common dream to write, dance and produce music that reflects our musical backgrounds as well as our life values of acceptance, vulnerability and being successful,”</em> said BTS’s leader, RM, in a 2017 interview with Time. Their debut single, <em>“No More Dream,”</em> was an ode to teen apathy. BTS’s success was due to mixing their openness on social media with blunt and honest lyrics — and owning their status as an underdog group battling to succeed against other bands who came from established studios with larger budgets. <em>“Dope”</em> openly celebrated the endless grind of their lives: “Over half of the day, we drown in work / Even if our youth rots in the studio / Thanks to that, we’re closer to success.”</p>

On behalf of the group, BTS&rsquo; leader RM delivered a six-minute speech in English about self-acceptance, as well as their Love Myself campaign. According to UNICEF, the goal of the initiative is &ldquo;to provide quality education and training for young people&rdquo;.
