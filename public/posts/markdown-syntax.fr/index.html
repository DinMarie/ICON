  <div class="post-content"><p>BTS is a world-famous K-pop group under BigHit Music, celebrated for their impactful music and global influence.</p>
<p><img alt="Bighit Music" loading="lazy" src="https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/bts"></p>
<p>BTS, an acronym of Bangtan Sonyeondan or &ldquo;Beyond The Scene,&rdquo; is a Grammy-nominated South Korean group that has been capturing the hearts of millions of fans globally since its debut in June 2013.</p>
<p>The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performance, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as &ldquo;21st century Pop Icons&rdquo; breaking countless world records. While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN &lsquo;Speak Yourself&rsquo; speech, the band has mobilized millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), collected four No. 1 songs in a span of 9 months, performed multiple sold-out stadium shows across the world, and been named TIME’s Entertainer of the Year 2020. BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd Grammy Awards and recognized with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-bts">History of BTS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#history-of-bts">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>2010-2012: Pre-debut</strong></p>
<p>BTS&rsquo; first members were recruited through Big Hit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hit it&rdquo; auditions in 2010 and 2011. The original lineup went through several changes before the final group of members was established in 2012. Half a year prior to debut, the members began building their name and creating a relationship with fans through Twitter, video blogs, fancafe posts, and by releasing various song covers via YouTube and SoundCloud.</p>
<p>Before debuting in 2013, RM was already performing as an underground rapper and had released several tracks informally, including a collaboration with Zico. Jin had been a student at Konkuk University, majoring in acting, before being streetcast for auditions, while Suga was an underground rapper in Daegu. J-Hope, who was part of a street dance team named NEURON, was active in the underground dancing scene, participating in various battles and competitions. Before joining Big Hit, Jimin entered Busan High School of Arts as the top student in modern dance, but later transferred to Korea Arts High School with V, who auditioned in Daegu. Jungkook was cast by multiple agencies after leaving auditions for Superstar K, but eventually chose Big Hit after seeing Rap Monster&rsquo;s rap.</p>

<p><strong>2013–2014: Debut and moderate success</strong></p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, the first installment in their &ldquo;school trilogy&rdquo; series, was released simultaneously with its lead single &ldquo;No More Dream&rdquo; on June 12, 2013. While the album peaked at number five on the Gaon Album Chart and sold over 105,000 copies, &ldquo;No More Dream&rdquo; and the subsequent single &ldquo;We Are Bulletproof Pt.2&rdquo; were not major hits. Expanding their endeavors into Japan, &ldquo;No More Dream&rdquo; was later re-recorded in Japanese and released on June 4, 2014.</p>
<p>The second part to the &ldquo;school trilogy&rdquo; was the extended play O!RUL8,2?, released on September 11, 2013, which sold over 120,000 copies to date and peaked at number four. Its supporting singles &ldquo;N.O&rdquo; and &ldquo;Attack on Bangtan&rdquo; (Korean: 진격의 방탄; Revised Romanization: Jingyeogui Bangtan) failed to chart high. That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS-MTV&rsquo;s Rookie King Channel Bangtan, based on a fake broadcast station, &ldquo;Channel Bangtan&rdquo;, through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea. At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 2013 Melon Music Awards and Golden Disc Awards and the 2014 Seoul Music Awards.</p>
<p>The last act to their &ldquo;school trilogy&rdquo;, Skool Luv Affair (2014) topped the Gaon Chart and sold over 200,000 copies. It also peaked at number three on Billboard&rsquo;s World Albums Chart. The album was supported by the singles &ldquo;Boy in Luv&rdquo; (Korean: 상남자; RR: Sang-namja) and &ldquo;Just One Day&rdquo; (Korean: 하루만; RR: Haruman). That June, BTS participated as judges for a K-pop cover dance competition in the Bridge to Korea festival in Russia, an event that aimed to promote tourism between the two countries, where they also performed on stage. In August, the group also attended KCON in Los Angeles. That same month, they released their first Korean studio album, Dark &amp; Wild, which peaked at number two on the Gaon Chart and sold over 200,000 copies. It was supported by two singles: &ldquo;Danger&rdquo; and &ldquo;War of Hormone&rdquo; (Korean: 호르몬 전쟁, RR: Horeumon Jeonjaeng).</p>
<p>Their Japanese studio album, Wake Up (2014), released that December, peaking at number three on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart and selling 25,000 copies. Along with re-recorded Japanese versions of older songs, it also contained the original tracks &ldquo;Wake Up&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Stars&rdquo;. Their first concert tour, 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, was held from October to December.</p>
<p><img alt="Bighit Music" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/vividfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/BTS_MAMA2016_WinningBackstageTweet.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>2015–2016: Mainstream breakthrough and commercial success</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of 2015, BTS toured Japan for the first time with their BTS&rsquo;s First Japan Tour-Wake Up: Open Your Eyes. They also held their second solo concert in Korea, BTS Live Trilogy – Episode 1: BTS Begins. Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (2015), was released that March and was the only Korean album to be included in Fuse&rsquo;s list of the &ldquo;27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far&rdquo; that year. The lead single &ldquo;I Need U&rdquo; was a top five hit on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart in South Korea and garnered BTS their first ever music show win on SBS MTV&rsquo;s The Show. Although the second single, &ldquo;Dope (Korean: 쩔어; RR: Jjeoreo)&rdquo;, peaked at number 44 on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart, its music video became BTS&rsquo; first to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube in October. &ldquo;Dope&rdquo; later peaked at number three on Billboard&rsquo;s World Digital Songs Chart. The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 have sold over 300,000 copies to date.</p>
<p>On March 17, 2015, the group&rsquo;s leader RM (then known as Rap Monster) released his first solo mixtape, the eponymous RM, for free on the streaming service SoundCloud. The mixtape was ranked 48th on the &ldquo;50 Best Hip Hop Albums of 2015&rdquo; list published by Spin Magazine.</p>
<p>BTS&rsquo; fourth Japanese single, &ldquo;For You&rdquo;, was released that June to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese debut. The single topped Oricon&rsquo;s daily chart, selling over 42,000 copies within its first day. They also commenced their 2015 Live Trilogy Episode: The Red Bullet world tour, and participated in the Summer Sonic Festival tour in Japan.</p>
<p>On August 16, 2016, Suga released his first solo mixtape titled Agust D for free on SoundCloud. The mixtape was listed among the &ldquo;Top 20 Mixtapes of the Year&rdquo; by Fuse TV.</p>
<p>During their three-day The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: On Stage tour, the group performed the new song &ldquo;Run&rdquo;, the lead single for the EP The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 later released on November 30, 2015. The album topped the weekly Gaon Album and Billboard World Albums charts and remained atop the latter for multiple weeks, making BTS the first K-pop act to achieve that feat. It also peaked at number 171 on the Billboard 200 Chart with over 5,000 copies. At the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards, they received the Best World Performer in recognition of their international fanbase.</p>
<p>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 and Part 2 were later combined into the The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016) edition, and was supported by three singles: the top 40 hit &ldquo;Epilogue: Young Forever&rdquo;, the top 10 hit &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; (Korean: 불타오르네; RR: Bultaoreune), and the top 20 hit &ldquo;Save Me&rdquo;. A two-day concert at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul was held in May to support the album, followed by their Asia tour. The group also headlined both US KCON shows held that year in New Jersey (June) and Los Angeles (July), to sold out audiences. Young Forever later won Album of the Year at the year-end Melon Music Awards, becoming the group&rsquo;s first major grand prize (daesang).</p>
<p>On September 7, 2016, BTS released their second Japanese studio album Youth, selling over 44,000 copies on its first day of release and ranking number one in Japan. Japanese editions of &ldquo;I Need U&rdquo; and &ldquo;Run&rdquo; were released as singles. Meanwhile, back in their home country, pre-orders for the group&rsquo;s second Korean studio album, Wings, released that October, accumulated over 500,000 copies within the first week. The lead single &ldquo;Blood Sweat &amp; Tears&rdquo; achieved an &ldquo;all-kill&rdquo; in South Korea, becoming their first number one hit on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart. Its music video gained over 6 million views within 24 hours, breaking the previous record held on YouTube for the highest number of views of a K-pop group music video within 24 hours. They later won Artist of the Year at the 2016 Mnet Asian Music Awards, becoming the first artist not from a &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; entertainment company (SM, YG and JYP) to do so.</p>
<p><img alt="Bighit Music" loading="lazy" src="https://www.korea.net/upload/content/editImage/bts_171206_article_01.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>You Never Walk Alone, Love Yourself: Her, and international recognition</strong></p>
<p>n early 2017, BTS embarked on their BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour. That February, pre-orders for the repackaged edition of Wings, entitled You Never Walk Alone, reached over 700,000 copies. The lead single &ldquo;Spring Day&rdquo; (Korean: 봄날; RR: Bomnal) topped eight of the major South Korean online music charts, as well as Gaon, and crashed Melon&rsquo;s digital chart due to the high influx of user traffic. It also entered the US Billboard&rsquo;s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at number 15 with &ldquo;zero promotions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On July 5, 2017, Big Hit Entertainment and BTS revealed a new logo for the band in a video released on the official YouTube channel. This video was accompanied by the announcement that in addition to being known as Bangtan Sonyeondan or Bulletproof Boy Scouts, their acronym would also stand for &ldquo;Beyond The Scene&rdquo; as part of their new brand identity. Also they gave A.R.M.Y (their fandom) a logo, which looks opposite to theirs.</p>
<p>Their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her (2017), was released that September and featured music from The Chainsmokers&rsquo; Andrew Taggart for the track &ldquo;Best of Me&rdquo;. The lead single &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; peaked at number two on the weekly Gaon Chart, while its music video reached over 20 million views on YouTube, breaking the record for most viewed K-pop group music video within the first 24 hours. &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; also became the group&rsquo;s first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 85, making BTS the first K-pop boy band to do so and the second Korean act with a Korean-language song. When &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; rose to number 67, it became the highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 for a K-pop group, beating Wonder Girls&rsquo; previous record at number 76. A remix for their song, &ldquo;MIC Drop&rdquo;, by Steve Aoki and Desiigner was released as the second single, peaking at number 23 in South Korea and number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first top 40 entry for a K-pop group on the chart.&ldquo;DNA&rdquo; and &ldquo;MIC Drop&rdquo; were later released as a triple-A side single in Japan with the new song &ldquo;Crystal Snow” which topped the Oricon Chart, becoming the highest-selling single from a K-pop artist within a week, and making BTS the first foreign artist to achieve this.</p>
<p>In November 2017, the group became the first K-pop group to perform at the American Music Awards. Following the performance, Guinness World Records announced that BTS will be included their 2018 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records for having the world&rsquo;s most Twitter engagements and specifically for most Twitter engagements by a music group. BTS was also named by Twitter to be the most tweeted-about artist of 2017, and ranked 1st worldwide in yearly social media engagements with 502 million likes and retweets.</p>
<p>They won their second Artist of the Year at the 2017 Mnet Asian Music Awards, becoming the first act to win the award two years in a row. &ldquo;Spring Day&rdquo; later won Best Song of the Year at the Melon Music Awards. That December, they performed on Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve to welcome the new year, making them the first K-pop group to be part of the show&rsquo;s lineup. They also made their Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi&rsquo;s Japan Music Station Super Live on December 22.</p>
<p>On December 12, BTS was represented on six of the Billboard &ldquo;Year End&rdquo; Charts. The group ranked No. 1 on the &ldquo;World Albums Artists&rdquo; chart, No. 2 on the &ldquo;World Albums&rdquo; chart, No. 1 on the &ldquo;Social 50 Artists&rdquo; chart, No. 2 on the &ldquo;Top Artists – Duo/Group&rdquo; chart, and No. 32 on the &ldquo;Independent Albums&rdquo; chart.

<p><strong>2018: Hope World, album certification, and international accolades</strong></p>
<p>In January 2018, the Recording Industry Association of Japan announced BTS&rsquo; first ever Double Platinum certification for their &ldquo;MIC Drop/DNA/Crystal Snow&rdquo; single, the only single album by a foreign artist in 2017 to sell over 500,000 copies and receive certification on the Oricon chart for that year. Later that month, BTS became the first artist outside of the &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; to win both Grand Prize Daesang awards at the Golden Disc Awards and the Seoul Music Awards respectively. In February, both the &ldquo;MIC Drop&rdquo; and &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; singles were certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, making BTS the first Korean act, and the only K-pop artist ever, to receive this.</p>
<p>On February 8, Big Hit won the award for its new Brand Identity (BI) with BTS&rsquo; logo under the Corporate Identity/Branding category within Communication Design at this year&rsquo;s award presentation, illustrating BTS&rsquo; worldwide influence.</p>
<p>On February 11, sales for Love Yourself: Her surpassed 1.58 million, the highest sales recorded for an album in Gaon Chart history.</p>
<p>Suga&rsquo;s mixtape, Agust D, was released unannounced on Spotify and iTunes worldwide for the first time on February 22, over 2 years since its original release. Within 24 hours, the album reached No. 1 on the worldwide iTunes charts and the iTunes Pop Charts. The following week, the album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard World Albums chart dated March 3, 2018.</p>
<p>On March 2, 2018, J-Hope released his first solo mixtape titled Hope World for free download on Google Drive, streaming on Spotify and SoundCloud, and for purchase on iTunes. The accompanying music video for the title track, &ldquo;Daydream&rdquo;, reached 1 million likes in 1 hour 43 minutes, making it the fastest Korean video to reach the benchmark. With 73 No. 1 spots on the iTunes chart worldwide by the end of its first day, Hope World tied with the previous BTS release, Love Yourself: Her, for the most No. 1 spots held by a Korean album on iTunes within the first 24 hours. As of March 5, the album remained at No. 1 on the iTunes Worldwide Charts, marking 5 days at No. 1 and breaking the record for the longest-charting Korean album at No. 1 on the chart previously held by Love Yourself: Her. The album debuted at No. 63 on the Billboard 200 Chart, making J-Hope the highest-charting solo K-pop act in Billboard 200 history. J-Hope also debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart, where fellow band mates RM and Suga (as Agust D) both previously peaked at No. 46.</p>
<p>The music video for &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; reached 300 million views on March 6, 2018, making it only one of 3 K-pop videos to reach the benchmark and the fastest video to do so to date. The video reached 300 million views in 5 months and 16 days, breaking the previous record of 13 months and 28 days by &ldquo;TT&rdquo; by TWICE.</p>
<p>On March 11, BTS won both the &ldquo;Best Fan Army&rdquo; and &ldquo;Best Boy Band&rdquo; awards at the 2018 iHeartRadio Awards held in California, although the group declined to attend the event due to a busy schedule as they prepare for their upcoming album release later this year.</p>
<p>An original documentary series, entitled Burn the Stage, that offers a behind-the-scenes look at the group&rsquo;s 2017 Wings Tour was officially announced on March 13. Consisting of eight episodes, it will premiere exclusively on YouTube Red and run from March 28 to May 9.</p>
<p>On April 4, 2018, their third Japanese studio album Face Yourself was released. Face Yourself topped the Japanese Oricon Weekly Album Chart for the week of April 2, with 282,000 copies. According to Japan&rsquo;s Oricon Chart on April 12, BTS&rsquo; 3rd Japanese album sold 282,000 copies in the first week (April 2-April 8). This breaks the record by KARA, who sold 275,000 copies of their Japanese album &lsquo;Super Girl&rsquo; in the first week of November 2011.</p>
<p>On April 5, 2018 at midnight KST, Big Hit released a video titled “Euphoria: Theme of LOVE YOURSELF 起 Wonder”, on their official YouTube channel. The clip appears to dub the band’s upcoming album, for the &lsquo;Love Yourself&rsquo; series, a follow-up to last year’s record-breaking EP Love Yourself: Her, it is believed to mark the beginning of a new era for the group, following the trend of previous BTS comebacks, though Big Hit Entertainment denies such claims.</p>
<p>The group later announced their third Korean-language LP, Love Yourself: Tear, on April 14, along with its May 18 release date.</p>

<p>BTS has been described as &ldquo;easily the biggest and most successful name in K-pop in the world&rdquo; that can &ldquo;do things no other name in their genre can.&rdquo; As the first Korean musician to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming second only to Drake.

Due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language, BTS became the youngest ever recipients to be awarded the Order of Cultural Merit by the President of South Korea.</p>
<p>BTS has measurably revitalized the Korean economy and the global music industry. Credited for the surge in popularity of online purchases of K-pop items and the growth of the Korean Wave between 2016 and 2018 by the Korea Customs Service and Korea Foundation, BTS was cited as one of the main driving forces for the recovery of South Korea’s music-related sector to levels seen before China’s 2016 ban on domestic cultural contents over soured diplomatic relations. Yung Duk Kim, vice president and chief operating officer of the Korea Creative Content Agency, stated K-pop has “skyrocketed” since BTS&rsquo; popularity surged, creating jobs not only for BTS and their team but other K-pop idols as well. Various news outlets coined the term the &ldquo;BTS effect&rdquo; to refer to the commercial effects of BTS&rsquo; influence, such as when KB Kookmin Bank savings accounts increased six-fold compared to the prior year following BTS&rsquo; endorsement and when stock prices of entertainment companies in South Korea shot up for five days after BTS topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The effect was also observed when companies tied to BTS, such as Netmarble, NetMark, Soribada, Key Shares, GMP, Diffie, and Mattelh ad their stocks rise. Data firm SM2 Networks estimated Hyundai Motor received ₩600 billion ($502 million) in promotional results after commissioning BTS as their promotional models in 2018. Signed on as tourism ambassadors in 2017, the Seoul Metropolitan Government credits BTS for the recovery of Seoul&rsquo;s shrinking tourism industry following the 2016 THAAD controversy, bringing in an average of 790,000 tourists to Korea annually. In December 2018, the Hyundai Research Institute estimated BTS was worth more than $3.67 billion to the Korean economy each year, attracting one in every thirteen foreigners who visit Korea. As of June 2019, BTS&rsquo; economic effect on South Korea is estimated to be over ₩5.5 trillion ($4.65 billion) per year. Along with Ariana Grande and Drake, BTS was credited as a key act boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018. Such profit had not been seen since 2006 after digital purchases gained momentum.</p>
<p>BTS&rsquo; work has influenced numerous artists, including (G)I-dle, D-Crunch&rsquo;s Hyunho, The Boyz&rsquo; Younghoon, SF9&rsquo;s Zuho, Euna Kim, Golden Child&rsquo;s Jaehyun, Wanna One, IN2IT, Park Ji-hoon, Kim Dong-han, Seven O&rsquo;Clock, Hyeongseop X Euiwoong, Noir,  Victon&rsquo;s Sejun, and Loona. After BTS released their single &ldquo;Idol,&rdquo; the National Gugak Center had to expand the amount of Korean instrument sounds available due to increased demand from Korean and foreign producers alike. K-pop idol groups also began changing the themes of their lyrics from love stories to words such as &ldquo;looking for myself&rdquo; following BTS&rsquo; &ldquo;Love Yourself&rdquo; era and RM&rsquo;s speech at the United Nations.</p>

<li>BTS Wasn&rsquo;t Always BTS: Before debut, the group had several potential names, including &ldquo;Big Kidz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Young Nation,&rdquo; but they settled on Bangtan Sonyeondan (Bulletproof Boy Scouts) to represent resilience and protection for youth.</li>
<li>The Birth of &lsquo;Borahae&rsquo;: BTS’s V (Kim Tae-hyung) coined the term &ldquo;Borahae&rdquo; (보라해) during a fan meeting in 2016. It means &ldquo;I Purple You&rdquo; and symbolizes love, trust, and loyalty between BTS and ARMY. Purple has since become the group’s signature color.</li>
